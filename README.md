# 🎧 AuralSight: A Multimodal Audio-Visual Learning Framework

**AuralSight** is a research-oriented deep learning framework that unifies **audio and visual information streams** to achieve context-aware perception.  
Inspired by human sensory integration, AuralSight leverages **cross-modal attention** and **temporal modeling** to understand complex real-world events through synchronized sound and vision.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

While vision models understand spatial features and audio models capture temporal dynamics, AuralSight bridges the gap between them by:
- Encoding **audio spectrograms** and **video frames** using dedicated feature extractors.
- Aligning and fusing them through **cross-modal attention layers**.
- Modeling temporal dependencies across both streams for **event-level understanding**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎬 **Dual-Stream Architecture:** Parallel encoders for audio and video inputs.  
- 🔁 **Cross-Modal Attention:** Learn fine-grained correspondences between sight and sound.  
- ⏱️ **Temporal Alignment:** Frame-wise and chunk-wise synchronization for real-world video/audio.  
- 📊 **Flexible Framework:** Compatible with PyTorch and open to extension for new modalities.  
- 🔍 **Applications:**  
  - Wildlife activity detection  
  - Audio-visual event recognition  
  - Surveillance and scene understanding  
  - Human–environment interaction modeling
